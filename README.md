# Maple-13-GR-TensorII-Calculations
Calculations of several tensors related to metrics such as; Einstein Field Tensor, Maxwell Stress Tensor, Equation of state, Electromagnetic Field Tensor, and much more

# Basic Maple Code:
Just a bunch of calculations on flat space and minkowski space along with some coordinate transformations

# FLRW
Calculations of several tensors for FLRW metric

# Curved FLRW
Same same FLRW but curve parameter k is implemented

# Schwarzschild
Calculations involving a sphereically symmetric metric which lead to a Schwarzschild solution

# TOV Equations
Usage of TOV equations to calculate geometric properties of a sphereical interior

# Reisnerr Nordstrom
Starting from a sphereically symmetric metric but coupling it to charge variable and calculating EM Field tensor to get Reissner Nordstrom solutions

# Kerr
Calculations for Kerr spacetime
